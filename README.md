# SteelPoll

SteelPoll is a web app for making privacy-focused polls that you can share and vote on live with friends.

## About

This is a passion project created and maintained by me, [Caleb Lovell](https://www.caleblovell.dev/).

Once upon a time, I studied political science and became fascinated by the way different voting systems prioritize different values, and can lead to vastly different outcomes.

This site uses [First Past The Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), [Ranked Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) and [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAR_voting) voting systems.

The site is also focused on privacy first. I use zero 3rd party cookies, collect no personal data and run no ads. And I never will!

## Local Installation
